Project Description/Outline

This project aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on multiple demographics across multiple countries that have been indicated as epicentres of the virus. 
Firstly, we will analyze the air quality in the indicated regions overtime during the pandemic and compare it to last year’s data. We will be cross-examining this with the number of COVID-19 cases to see if there is any correlation between COVID-19 active cases and air quality. 
Secondly, we will analyze the CO2 emissions of the indicated regions overtime during the pandemic and compare that data to last year’s data. We will be cross-examining this as well with the number of active COVID-19 cases for that region to verify if there is a correlation between COVID-19 and CO2 emission.
Figures will indicate any key milestones and developments announced regarding the state of COVID-19 for that region (ex: indication of when a  lockdown began).

Research Questions to Answer
*What is the environmental impact of a pandemic on senior citizens across each country?

*What is the environmental impact of a pandemic on CO2 emissions in Cities?
Can also compare to gas consumption
traffic?
What is the environmental impact of a pandemic on waste in Cities?
Can compare medical waste, food waste

Datasets to be Used:

Timeframe = First case from cities in list - today vs. same time frame last year
Cities =[“New York City, US”, “Milan, Italy”, “Hong Kong, China”,”São Paulo, Brazil ”, “Cape Town, South Africa”]
